# Triple Helix Innovation Script

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the **Triple Helix Innovation Model**, which represents the interaction between academia, industry, and government in knowledge-based economies.

## The Triple Helix Model

The Triple Helix model illustrates how innovation emerges from the dynamic interaction of three institutional spheres:

1. **Academia** (Universities & Research Institutions) - Knowledge creation, research, and education
2. **Industry** (Private Sector & Business) - Innovation application, commercialization, and products
3. **Government** (Public Sector & Policy) - Regulation, funding, and infrastructure support

Innovation occurs at the intersection of all three spheres working together.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher

## Usage

### Running the script

You can run the script in two ways:

**Method 1: Using Python directly**
```bash
python3 triple-helix-innovation.py
```

**Method 2: As an executable**
```bash
./triple-helix-innovation.py
```

### Output

The script displays:
- Current date and time in UTC (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format)
- Current user's login name
- Script location
- Visual representation of the Triple Helix innovation model
- Python version information

### Example Output

```

                    TRIPLE HELIX INNOVATION MODEL                     
======================================================================

    The Triple Helix model represents the interaction between:
    
    1. ACADEMIA (Universities & Research Institutions)
       └─ Knowledge creation, research, education
       
    2. INDUSTRY (Private Sector & Business)
       └─ Innovation application, commercialization, products
       
    3. GOVERNMENT (Public Sector & Policy)
       └─ Regulation, funding, infrastructure support
    
    These three spheres work together in a dynamic relationship:
    
         ╔═══════════╗
         ║ ACADEMIA  ║
         ╚═══════════╝
              / \
             /   \
            /     \
           /       \
    ╔═══════════╗   ╔═══════════╗
    ║ INDUSTRY  ║───║ GOVERNMENT║
    ╚═══════════╝   ╚═══════════╝
    
    Innovation occurs at the intersection of all three!
